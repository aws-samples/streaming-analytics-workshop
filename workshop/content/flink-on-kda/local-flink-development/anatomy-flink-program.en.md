According to the [Flink documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/datastream/overview/#anatomy-of-a-flink-program), a Flink program consists of the following basic parts:
    
1. Obtain an execution environment,
1. Load/create the initial data,
1. Specify transformations on this data,
1. Specify where to put the results of your computations, and
1. Trigger the program execution

If you are attending an AWS hosted event, we will cover the different parts in a presentation format. If you are running the workshop on your own, please refer to the official [Flink documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/datastream/overview/#anatomy-of-a-flink-program) to learn more about the anatomy of a Flink program.
